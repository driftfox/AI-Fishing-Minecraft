Original project can be found at [https://github.com/aidancgardner/AI-Fishing-Minecraft](https://github.com/aidancgardner/AI-Fishing-Minecraft) 

## Getting started:

To use this script you will need Python 3 installed. You will also need to install the dependencies before you can run this script. You can install the dependencies with `pip` after Python 3 is installed.

In a nutshell:
1. Install Python 3
2. Open the command line
3. Install the dependencies by running the following commands:
   - `pip install opencv-python`
   - `pip install pyautogui`
   - `pip install screeninfo`
   - `pip install keyboard`

## To use:

1. Make sure both the py file and bobber.png are in the same folder/directory
2. Open a command line pointed at the folder where the py and bobber.png files are (one quick way to do this in Windows is to right click on the folder and choose "Open terminal here")
3. Start the script by running `python fishing_ai.py`
4. Open Minecraft
5. Position your minecraft character by water and cast your rod 
6. Press 'u' key to toggle on and off to fish for you
